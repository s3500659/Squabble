## Deploying the code

 The code can be deployed to any number of hosts, options are Netlify, AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure and
 more!

 We chose Azure Static Web App to deploy our code and the instructions to follow our setup can be 
 found in the Azure documentation portal
 [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?tabs=angular).


### Initialise database and seed data

The Squabble Server has been configured to both initialise the database if you are starting from fresh and also fill it with seed data by running the below commands:

sh
dotnet ef database update

This runs all the scripts in the `/Migrations` folder to set up the database.

### Azure services

We rely on a number of Azure services to run the Squabble application. The guides to deploy each
are listed here.
